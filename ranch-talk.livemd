## Talk Timer

This talk is supposed to be 5-15 minutes long, so let's make sure we keep it that way with a timer and a super annoying alert!

```elixir
alias RanchTalk.TalkTimer

%{
  # 10 minutes
  seconds_to_count: 3,
  done_message: "Time's up! Shut up and get back to work!"
}
|> TalkTimer.new()
|> TalkTimer.start()
```

## Ranch Overview

```elixir
:observer.start()
```
